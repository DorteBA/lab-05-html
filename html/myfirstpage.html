    <h1>Jazz</h1>
    <p>Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans, Louisiana,
         United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with its roots in blues and ragtime.
         Since the 1920s Jazz Age, it has been recognized as a major form of musical expression in traditional 
         and popular music, linked by the common bonds of African-American and European-American musical parentage.</p>
         <br>
    <p>The mid-1950s saw the emergence of hard bop, which introduced influences from rhythm and blues, gospel, and blues, 
        especially in the saxophone and piano playing. Modal jazz developed in the late 1950s, using the mode, or musical
         scale, as the basis of musical structure and improvisation, as did free jazz, which explored playing without regular
          meter, beat and formal structures. Jazz-rock fusion appeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s, combining jazz improvisation
           with rock music's rhythms, electric instruments, and highly amplified stage sound.</p>
        <br>
    <p>Although jazz is considered difficult to define, in part because it contains many subgenres, improvisation is one of its defining 
        elements. The centrality of improvisation is attributed to the influence of earlier forms of music such as blues, a form of folk
         music which arose in part from the work songs and field hollers of African-American slaves on plantations. These work songs were
          commonly structured around a repetitive call-and-response pattern, but early blues was also improvisational. Classical music performance
           is evaluated more by its fidelity to the musical score, with less attention given to interpretation, ornamentation, and accompaniment. 
           The classical performer's goal is to play the composition as it was written.</p>
